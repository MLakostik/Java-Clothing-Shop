# Java Clothing Shop

### Description

This is a project I completed for my enterprise Java class at Sheridan College. I created a simple online clothing store web application that contains a shopping cart and invoice system. I created the application in java using servlets and JSP's. You'll find a home page with all of the products, a page that displays what items are currently in your cart and a final invoice page which displays the prices of all of the items to add to your cart along with various sales taxes and shipping fees.


### Features
- Uses local storage to save the items you selected
- A session is created to store an array list of products
- All items added to cart are added to an invoice with their price and a description
