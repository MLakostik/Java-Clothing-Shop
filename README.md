# Java Clothing Shop

### Description

This is a project I completed for my enterprise Java class at Sheridan College. I created a simple web application using servlets and JSP's which allows adding various clothing products to your cart which then save to a session that displays the selected items in other pages within the application. You'll find a home page with all of the products (essentially a store page), a page that displays what items are currently in your cart and a final invoice page which displays the prices of all of the items to add to your cart along with various sales taxes and shipping fees.


### Features
- Uses local storage to save the items you selected
- A session is created to store an array list of products
- All items added to cart are added to an invoice with their price and a description
